Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 38-year-old man with no significant history of back pain developed acute LBP when lifting boxes 2 weeks ago. The pain is aching in nature, located in the left lumbar area, and associated with spasms. He describes previous similar episodes several years ago, which resolved without seeing a doctor. He denies any leg pain or weakness. He also denies fevers, chills, weight loss, and recent infections. Over-the-counter ibuprofen has helped somewhat, but he has taken it only twice a day for the past 3 days because he does not want to become dependent on painkillers. On examination, there is decreased lumbar flexion and extension secondary to pain, but a neurologic exam is unremarkable.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 38-year-old man with no significant history of back pain developed acute LBP when lifting boxes 2 weeks ago. The pain is aching in nature, located in the left lumbar area, and associated with spasms. He describes previous similar episodes several years ago, which resolved without seeing a doctor. He denies any leg pain or weakness. He also denies fevers, chills, weight loss, and recent infections. Over-the-counter ibuprofen has helped somewhat, but he has taken it only twice a day for the past 3 days because he does not want to become dependent on painkillers. On examination, there is decreased lumbar flexion and extension secondary to pain, but a neurologic exam is unremarkable.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 38-year-old man with no significant history of back pain developed acute LBP when lifting boxes 2 weeks ago. The pain is aching in nature, located in the left lumbar area, and associated with spasms. He describes previous similar episodes several years ago, which resolved without seeing a doctor. He denies any leg pain or weakness. He also denies fevers, chills, weight loss, and recent infections. Over-the-counter ibuprofen has helped somewhat, but he has taken it only twice a day for the past 3 days because he does not want to become dependent on painkillers. On examination, there is decreased lumbar flexion and extension secondary to pain, but a neurologic exam is unremarkable.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

He denies any leg pain or weakness. He also denies fevers, chills, weight loss, and recent infections. Over-the-counter ibuprofen has helped somewhat, but he has taken it only twice a day for the past 3 days because he does not want to become dependent on painkillers. On examination, there is decreased lumbar flexion and extension secondary to pain, but a neurologic exam is unremarkable.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 38-year-old man with no significant history of back pain developed acute LBP when lifting boxes 2 weeks ago. The pain is aching in nature, located in the left lumbar area, and associated with spasms. He describes previous similar episodes several years ago, which resolved without seeing a doctor. He denies any leg pain or weakness. He also denies fevers, chills, weight loss, and recent infections. Over-the-counter ibuprofen has helped somewhat, but he has taken it only twice a day for the past 3 days because he does not want to become dependent on painkillers. On examination, there is decreased lumbar flexion and extension secondary to pain, but a neurologic exam is unremarkable.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 38-year-old man with no significant history of back pain developed acute LBP when lifting boxes 2 weeks ago. The pain is aching in nature, located in the left lumbar area, and associated with spasms. He describes previous similar episodes several years ago, which resolved without seeing a doctor. He denies any leg pain or weakness. He also denies fevers, chills, weight loss, and recent infections. Over-the-counter ibuprofen has helped somewhat, but he has taken it only twice a day for the past 3 days because he does not want to become dependent on painkillers. On examination, there is decreased lumbar flexion and extension secondary to pain, but a neurologic exam is unremarkable.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 38-year-old man with no significant history of back pain developed acute LBP when lifting boxes 2 weeks ago. The pain is aching in nature, located in the left lumbar area, and associated with spasms. He describes previous similar episodes several years ago, which resolved without seeing a doctor. He denies any leg pain or weakness. He also denies fevers, chills, weight loss, and recent infections. Over-the-counter ibuprofen has helped somewhat, but he has taken it only twice a day for the past 3 days because he does not want to become dependent on painkillers. On examination, there is decreased lumbar flexion and extension secondary to pain, but a neurologic exam is unremarkable.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.

Vignette: A 63-year-old man sustained a cut on his hand while gardening. His immunization history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunization schedule. He presents with signs of generalized tetanus with trismus (""lock jaw""), which results in a grimace described as ""risus sardonicus"" (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonus, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apneic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalized spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension.
